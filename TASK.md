# Requirements

Create a placeholder pipe, that can be used on string value and will replace it with default, if value is null, undefined or empty string.
Placeholder value should be 'None' by default but should be customizable by passing an argument to the pipe.

## Advanced

Created an overloaded placeholder version, that will also accept numeric values and return a placeholder value if value is undefined, null or NaN.
